              This Privacy Policy is to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and
              disclosure of Personal Information (as defined below) we receive when you visit and use the Services. As
              used in this Privacy Policy, the “Services” means the services provided by Expense Manager for discovering
              and watching video programs, including all features and functionalities, the Expense Manager User
              Interfaces, as well as all content and software associated with the services. This Privacy Policy applies
              only to information that you provide to us through the Services, and when you access or use any information,
              services, products or content offered by Expense Manager through the Services. This Privacy Policy may be

            <h5>The Information We Collect</h5>

            <p>
              In the course of using the Services, we ask you to provide us with certain information that could reasonably
              be used to contact you or identify you personally ("Personal Information"). Personal Information may
              include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, email address and postal address. Personal
              Information also includes your IP address or other unique identifier that is associated, on a persistent or
              on-going basis, with your computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a "Device") you use to access the
              Services.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some features on the Services may ask users to provide certain information that is not personally
              identifiable, such as city or state of residence, date of birth and gender. Such demographic information is
              referred to collectively, along with Usage Information (defined below), as “Non-Personal Information.”
              Non-Personal Information is generally non-identifying, but, if we associate it with you as an identifiable
              individual, we will treat it as Personal Information.{' '}

              Microsoft Windows or Mac OS), the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox), the
              domain name of the Internet service provider you are using (e.g., Verizon), and your activity while using
              our Services (e.g., which of our pages you have viewed, and the content viewed) (“Usage Information”).{' '}
